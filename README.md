## Instructions

- **To use this:** Run the exe located in the ZIP to spawn in a Cababas (may or may not be flagged by anti-virus)
- **Watch** as Cababas trots in and hops around the bottom of your screen! (if he's getting in the way, click on him to make him jump)
- **To close the program:** double click on the icon that appears in the 'hidden icons' tray in your task bar. Depending on your device, the icon might appear on your taskbar instead of this tray.
